      <button class="accordion">What is Coffee?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans.</p>
      </div>
  
      <button class="accordion">Where does Coffee come from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Coffee comes from the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. 
          All fruit must be further processed from a raw material—the fruit and seed—into a stable, 
          raw product; un-roasted, green coffee. To process the berries, the seed is separated from the fruit to produce green coffee. 
          Green coffee is then roasted, a process which transforms the raw product (green coffee) into a consumable product (roasted coffee).</p>

      <button class="accordion">How do I make Coffee?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Roasted coffee is ground into a powder and mixed with water to produce a cup of coffee. Some examples of methods are drip, french press, aeropress, percolater, pourover, and instant coffee.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">How long have people been drinking Coffee?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.
           The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.</p>
